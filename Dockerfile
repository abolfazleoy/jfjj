# ── persistent data on Docker PaaS (blitz.cloud, Render, Fly, a plain VPS) ────
# A container's filesystem is thrown away when it restarts. blitz.cloud keeps
# EXACTLY the folders the image declares with VOLUME (and reserves plan storage
# for them), so /data must be declared here — otherwise shop.db, manager.db and
# every clients/<uid>/ session are lost on each restart/deploy, which looks
# exactly like "the bot forgets everything every few hours".
#
# DATA_DIR is deliberately NOT set here: railway-start.sh still owns that
# decision (it picks the writable Volume and refuses a dir that shadows the
# code), so an existing Railway/Render install keeps working unchanged.
# blitz-start.sh sets DATA_DIR=/data for blitz.cloud.
